# Flappy-Bird 

Flappy Bird is one of the best games that I played when I was 14 or 15 years old. I wanted to improve my skills in Unity and C#, while also revisiting old memories, by recreating this legendary game.I have used Player, GameCamera, GameController and ParallaxLayer
scripts in order to control the behavior of the game. Player class controls the player character's movement, interactions with obstacles and scoring mechanisms, and manages events like scoring and killing the player. ParallaxLayer class handles the parallax
scrolling effect for a particular layer in the game, shifting elements based on the player's movement to create an illusion of depth. GameController class manages the overall game state, including UI elements, obstacle and score area spawning, and game restarts,
and also listens for player events to update the score or detect game over. GameCamera class is responsible for controlling the camera's movement to follow the player in the game world. I have also used animation and animation controller for Flappy Birds flap.
